Disc stacks
-----------

GameViewModel to have WhiteDiscs and BlackDiscs, holding collections of new DiscViewModels.
GameView to have AbsoluteLayout and construct own stacks of discs.
When moving a disc, set size and animate coords,
then add DiscVM to cell vm?

Have switched DiscView to use DiscStateEnum.

Next:

Engine to be only concerned with Cells and their state (Off, Black, White)
Only BoardView to deal with dics - manage pool, stacks, color and location

Need to communicate the sequence list of moves to the BoardView
does a disc need a unique number?


New
---

BoardView to hold collections of CellViews and DiscViews.
BoardView to have an IsBusy prop to notify VM when it's animating.
* CellView content define in controlTemplate in default style (so can be changed)
BoardView controls state of Disc
BoardView to maintain assignment of discs to cells
BV to store links between VMs and Vs.
How to communicate cell/disc state from VM to View?
PlaySet: 
	move disc x from stack to cell y
	move disc x from cell y to stack
	list of cell/disc numbers to flip/change state
